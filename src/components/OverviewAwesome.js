                <h2>What's' So Awesome about Two Barrels?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>We do everything in house.</b> It’s all-too-common
                        for modern tech companies to contract out writers and designers
                        for individual projects. Some companies have developers who have never
                        met in person because they’re all working remotely. Software engineers,
                        systems engineers, front-end developers, designers, writers—at Two Barrels,
                        we all work in the same building. Full time, not contracted out. Every
                        person who contributes to a project can talk to each other and work
                        together from beginning to end. And one of the best things
                        about this? We make really good friends here.</li>
                    <li><b>We're trusted to explore solutions.</b>
                        While large projects are assigned, we often end up creating our own,
                        smaller projects to fix problems, make processes more efficient, or improve
                        SEO. We have freedom to test out hypotheses, try out new voices in
                        writing projects, and build things that will help the team.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>We're encouraged to have a life outside of work.</b>
                        So many employers are willing to lose an amazing employee because they’re unwilling
                        to accommodate life outside of work. Employees have families. They have daycare
                        drop-off times to negotiate. Late-night concerts. Early morning gym classes. Plumbing
                        disasters. At Two Barrels, we need to see each other to work together, so we have a
                        basic schedule of Monday through Friday, roughly 8 hours a day. But our start and end
                        times are flexible. We can come in at 6am one day and 10am the next. If we need to
                        take a two-hour break midday for a dentist appointment, that’s no problem.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>We don't have to get promoted to get a raise.</b>
                        Honestly, the corporate ladder is kind of a dumb idea. Why hire the best engineers
                        and designers and then tell them they can’t make more money unless they move up into
                        management? That’s how companies lose their best workers (and end up with lousy
                        management). At Two Barrels, we’re hired for the job we do best. Writers write.
                        Coders code. Then we get annual raise opportunities. We never have to give up a
                        position we love and excel at for a “promotion.”
                    </li>
                    <li><b>We have the tools we need for our jobs.</b>
                        A recent example—one of our designers made an offhand comment that illustrations would
                        be much easier if she had an iPad Pro. The office manager told her to find one online
                        and send her a link. She ordered it for her the same day, and our designer was illustrating
                        on her new device within the week. The company trusts that we know what we need to do our
                        jobs best. We don’t get everything under the sun (apparently we go through Slim Jims “too fast”),
                        but we can request what we need and get it more often than not.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>We're hired based on our skills, not made-up criteria</b>
                        Some people here have 20+ years of experience. Others are just a year or two into the
                        industry. A few people have multiple graduate degrees. Others are self-taught. What matters
                        most is the skills we bring to the table.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>We're allowed to be comfortable.</b>
                        We have an open office where we can get up whenever we want. We can listen to music. We
                        have floor mats and standing desks for people who think better on their feet. We’re not
                        client-facing, so there’s no dress code. Sneakers, heels, bunny slippers…we can work however
                        we work best.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>We're here for the long haul.</b>
                        We’ve grown so much that the company just bought a 65,000 square foot building in the heart
                        of downtown Spokane. Our new home is currently being built out specifically to meet our team’s
                        needs. Private space to work. Stand up areas. Sprint planning areas. Everything a modern tech
                        team could dream of.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What's Up with the Two Barrels Name?</h3>
                <p>Well. Glad you’re wondering. The name Two Barrels was inspired by the great thought leader: Yosemite
                    Sam. Sometimes in software it can feel like you’re chasing a rascally rabbit around a tree. A bug
                    gets the best of you. You over think it. You under think it. You over manage it. You under manage
                    it. But we just keep coming and quite often sound like a blabbering bozo on the path. But we try to
                    at least have fun while figuring it out. Even if it flops…. we know we gave it a full two barrels
                    trying.</p>
