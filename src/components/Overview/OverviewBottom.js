			<h2>What is Two Barrels?</h2>
			<p>
				Well… it’s not a gun company or a brewery…. Two Barrels LLC is a
				subsidiary of{" "}
				<a

				>
					Registered Agents Inc
				</a>{" "}
				Two Barrels services our parent company’s tech needs. We have an
				information technology team, a software team, a marketing team, and a
				Dumpster Fire team – I mean Operations group. These teams work together
				to build and maintain all aspects of our parent company’s websites and
				to support any other tech products and projects that are needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				We’re locally owned and operated. Debt free. No venture capital or
				shareholders pulling the strings. We don’t do work for 3rd parties. We
				don’t have budgets. Two Barrels is truly a unique opportunity and
				environment in Spokane and Austin.
			</p>
			<p>
				We support an operational staff of around 750, so we’re always looking
				for good humans that can help.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our goal is to provide a stable, quality job where the work matters. We
				don’t have a lot of fancy titles or beautiful org charts. We have lots
				of talent though where the work itself brings fulfillment. If doing good
				and great work is fulfilling to you, we’d love to talk about hiring you.
			</p>
			<p>
				We’ve grown into Spokane’s largest tech employer as of 2021. And we’re
				no where close to where we need to be. We’re continually growing our
				team as we provide the backbone for millions of businesses throughout
				the US.
