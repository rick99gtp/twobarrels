				<p>
					Our 2 Barrels Austin is our second hub. It’s pretty weird, but Spokane
					WA is our tech headquarters, but we do own our Austin building and
					have had a small but effective team in Austin and we’d like to grow
					it. Whether that’s working onsite or working wherever, we hope you’ll
					find our Austin hub a welcoming place to call your work home, or at
					least a place that the air conditioner stays on reliably and in a part
					of town that isn’t insane to get to — check!
				</p>
				<p>
					As everyone in the world seems to want to move to Austin right now, we
					wrote a page here to try to help some of you from out of town
					understand the advantages of living and working here versus other
					options you may have. Here in Austin, the city has a lot to offer for
					everyone—the artsy, the outdoorsy, the family-focused and those just
					ready to party the night away.
				</p>
				<h2>Live Music Capital of the World</h2>
				<p>
					You ever wonder what life would be like with a soundtrack? With live
					music everywhere in Austin, a soundtrack to your life is almost
					unavoidable. Walking down the street, you’ll hear garage bands
					tinkering and squeeze around marching bands practicing. Pop into a
					coffee shop, bar or restaurant and you’re suddenly an audience member
					for a show you didn’t even know was happening.
				</p>
				<p>
					And all that is outside the revolving door of festivals like{" "}
					<a href="https://www.sxsw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
						SXSW
					</a>{" "}
					and{" "}
					<a
						href="https://austincitylimits.com/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Austin City Limits
					</a>{" "}
					or the stadium concerts for artists like The Rolling Stones or The
					Weeknd. Whether you just like to see a show now and then, are looking
					for bandmates or stage time, or just want to find more people out
					supporting the weird niche genre you love, Austin provides.
				</p>
				<h2>Head Outdoors</h2>
				<p>
					Our office has a lot of runners. Most of us don’t do marathons, but we
					could if really wanted to. In late February, runners from all over
					come to downtown Austin for the annual{" "}
					<a
						href="https://youraustinmarathon.com/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Austin Marathon
					</a>
					. Meanwhile, there’s probably a 5K to celebrate or support something
					just about every weekend.
				</p>
				<p>
					If an endurance race seems like overkill, we don’t even have to leave
					downtown to kayak or paddleboard Lady Bird Lake. And the{" "}
					<a
						href="https://austinparks.org/barton-creek-greenbelt/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Barton Creek Greenbelt
					</a>{" "}
					has miles of trails for hiking, biking, rockclimbing or just soaking
					in the nature (and getting a break from the city). And with many more
					sunny days than not, most of us take advantage of fair-weather
					activities nearly year-round.
				</p>
				<h2>Festivals, Festivals, Festivals</h2>
				<p>
					Austin takes everything we love (or even just kind of like a little
					bit) and turns it into an over-the-top festival.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Motorcycles? </strong>We have the{" "}
						<a
							href="https://www.republicoftexasmotorcyclerally.com/"
							target="_blank"
							rel="noopener"
						>
							Republic of Texas Motorcycle Rally
						</a>
						, the biggest rally in the state.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Bodypainting and drum circles? </strong>We celebrate{" "}
						<a href="https://eeyores.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
							Eeyore’s birthday
						</a>{" "}
						(yep, the depressed donkey from Winnie the Pooh) with a music jam
						and picnic at Pease District Park.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Horror, action and sci-fi/fantasy flicks?</strong> Each fall
						brings{" "}
						<a href="https://fantasticfest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
							Fantastic Fest
						</a>
						, a week of genre films, from shorts to premieres (John Wick and
						Zombieland premiered at this fest!).
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Fringe theater?</strong> When was the last time you saw a
						play? You can check out dozens of live performances during the 5
						weeks of FronteraFest.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Kites?</strong> Nothing’s too niche for a festival in
						Austin. You can act like a kid again at{" "}
						<a
							href="https://www.abckitefest.org/"
							target="_blank"
							rel="noopener"
						>
							ABC Kite Fest
						</a>
						.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>For Kids AND Kids at Heart</h2>
				<p>
					While Austin might come across as a sort of Neverland full of Peter
					Pans who never want to grow up, it’s not just a party town. Okay, it’s
					not exactly a quiet suburb either, but it’s reasonably
					family-friendly. Austin’s regularly ranked as one of the safest large
					cities in the US (and the cost of living is below the national
					average). Our local Eanes Independent School District is also{" "}
					<a
						href="https://www.niche.com/k12/search/best-school-districts/s/texas/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						ranked as the number one district
					</a>{" "}
					in all of Texas.
				</p>
				<p>
					When it comes to all things educational, the whole city is dotted with
					museums. Loads of history and art museums. The{" "}
					<a
						href="https://www.austintexas.gov/department/austin-nature-science-center"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Austin Nature &amp; Science Center
					</a>
					. And of course, a{" "}
					<a
						href="https://www.texasmusicmuseum.org/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						music museum
					</a>
					. Parks are everywhere as well. And while most cities have a crowded
					municipal pool, we have Barton Springs, a THREE-ACRE pool where you
					can swim outdoors year round.
				</p>
				<h2>Eat Your Heart Out</h2>
				<p>
					One of the advantages of living in a tourist haven like Austin is all
					the food. Top chefs set up shop, local eateries compete to become the
					next “it” place—and we reap the benefits. With everyone trying to
					out-concoct each other, there’s always something new to try. And with
					all the festivals, it makes sense that we have loads and loads of food
					trucks, serving up everything from kimchi fries to strawberry lemonade
					cupcakes.
				</p>
				<p>
					And yeah, there’s plenty of food festivals too (seriously, everything
					here becomes a festival eventually). There’s{" "}
					<a
						href="https://rodeoaustin.com/events/bbq-austin/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Rodeo Austin’s BBQ Cook Off
					</a>{" "}
					and the{" "}
					<a
						href="https://www.austinchronicle.com/hot-sauce/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Austin Chronicle Hot Sauce Festival
					</a>
					. Beyond the more typical southern fare, we also have the annual
					Mediterranean Festival—if you’ve never tried Arabic coffee, you’re in
					for a treat.
				</p>
				<h2>We Got Wild Life AND Wildlife</h2>
				<p>
					Okay, so we don’t have a cool cryptid claim-to-fame like our buds up
					in Spokane (who said they’d let us know if they ever spot Sasquatch).
					But if you slip under a local bridge, you might stumble upon different
					creatures of the night. No, not drunken concert goers—well, not just
					drunken concertgoers—but over a MILLION bats. Much like most
					Austinites, the bats go out to enjoy the nightlife, so an Austin
					sunset often has that nice Halloween vibe.
				</p>
				<p>
					To celebrate Austin cosplaying as Gotham, we do what we always do
					here—put on a festival. At the{" "}
					<a
						href="http://www.roadwayevents.com/event/bat-fest/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Bat Festival
					</a>{" "}
					in late summer, you can dress up for the costume contest and watch as
					a cloud of bats burst out from under the Congress Avenue Bridge.
				</p>
				<p align="center">***</p>
				<p>
					All this is just the tip of the iceberg—there’s also Austin’s thriving
					comedy scene, the{" "}
					<a
						href="https://austin.com/visiting-the-cathedral-of-junk/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						junk cathedral
					</a>
					, all the murals,{" "}
					<a
						href="https://mayfieldpark.org/mayfield-park-and-preserve-overview/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						the park with all the peacocks
					</a>
					, and so much more. But some of it you just have to experience
					yourself. We hope you do.
