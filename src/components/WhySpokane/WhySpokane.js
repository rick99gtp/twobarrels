				<h1 className="job-details-title">So, Why Spokane?</h1>
				<p>
					Why would Two Barrels become Spokane’s largest tech employer and base
					their nationwide tech operation out of Spokane? That’s a great
					question that we ask ourselves like every week… The answer is it was
					probably a dumb decision, but we’ve made the best of it. And for a lot
					of reasons, what started out as probably a bad idea, has turned into
					something kind of cool.
				</p>
				<p>
					You kind of want to live here… or you need to if you’re gonna last
					here… and if you do live here, you’re not typically super one-sided on
					politics, or you’re at least pretty dang open-minded to people that
					don’t see stuff your way. It’s kind of a place that runs down the
					middle on a lot of things. It’s kind of a place where the people who
					grew up here know the benefits of staying, so they value culture and
					relationships. And if you moved here, you kind of sought it out and
					understand all the cool boxes it checks. So you’re kind of into an
					elevated way of living, and we try to have an elevated type of job
					here—so there’s a lot of alignment usually. We just get access to
					really cool humans that actually want to live here
				</p>
				<p>
					While Spokane can have a small-town feel, we are the 2nd largest city
					in Washington. We have it all—just without all the traffic,
					congestion, and crazy housing prices you’ll find in the state’s
					largest city.
				</p>
				<h2>Spokane fast facts</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>76 lakes within 50 minutes of downtown</li>
					<li>
						5 mountain resorts within 2 hours drive.{" "}
						<a href="https://www.mtspokane.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
							Mt Spokane
						</a>{" "}
						is 45 min from downtown and you can get a parking spot as late as
						11:00 am!
					</li>
					<li>average commute time of 19 minutes</li>
					<li>average cost for a 1 bedroom apartment is $890</li>
					<li>
						our home values went up 13% in 2019 alone ( well. it’s 2021 now… and
						crap. that didn’t last… )
					</li>
					<li>
						cost of living is 7% below the national average&nbsp; ( who freaking
						knows now… it’s 2021…)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					That’s Spokane by the numbers. And they’re pretty sweet numbers. But
					how do you know if you’ll feel at home here? Our city has a little
					something for every personality.
				</p>
				<h2>Outdoorsy?</h2>
				<p>
					Spokane is absolutely surrounded by nature. We attract loads of
					outdoor runners with our gorgeous trails, like our{" "}
					<a
						href="https://spokanecentennialtrail.org/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Centennial Trail
					</a>
					. Each May, the city also hosts{" "}
					<a
						href="https://www.bloomsdayrun.org/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Bloomsday
					</a>
					—a 12K road race drawing in thousands every year. A couple months
					later, we also celebrate all things basketball with{" "}
					<a
						href="https://www.spokanehoopfest.net/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Hoopfest
					</a>
					, the largest outdoor 3-on-3 basketball tournament in the world. For
					camping and hiking (or fishing, kayaking, snowshoeing or rock
					climbing) we’re also home to{" "}
					<a
						href="https://parks.state.wa.us/573/Riverside"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Riverside State Park
					</a>
					. Skiers and snowboarders can get to Mt Spokane from downtown in under
					an hour. Or if you want to drive a little further, we have plenty more
					places to barrel down a mountain, like{" "}
					<a href="https://www.ski49n.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
						49 Degrees North
					</a>
					, <a href="https://www.silvermt.com/">Silver Mountain</a>,{" "}
					<a href="https://www.schweitzer.com/">Schweitzer</a> and{" "}
					<a href="https://skilookout.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
						Lookout Pass
					</a>
					.
				</p>
				<p>
					Just into the scenery? How about a downtown waterfall? Or the 100-acre{" "}
					<a
						href="https://my.spokanecity.org/riverfrontspokane/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Riverfront Park
					</a>
					,&nbsp;conveniently located within walking distance from the office.
					And for a killer outdoor concert, the one-of-a-kind{" "}
					<a
						href="http://www.georgeamphitheatre.com/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Gorge Amphitheater
					</a>{" "}
					is just two hours away.
				</p>
				<h2>Sports fan?</h2>
				<p>
					We’ve got our very own minor league baseball team, the{" "}
					<a href="https://www.milb.com/spokane" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
						Spokane Indians
					</a>
					—with surprisingly reasonably-priced concessions. And if you’ve never
					seen arena football, you can check out the{" "}
					<a href="https://thespokaneshock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
						Spokane Shock
					</a>
					. Since we’re a stone’s throw from Canada, it kind of makes sense our
					city has a hockey fanbase too—we’re home to the{" "}
					<a href="https://spokanechiefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
						Spokane Chiefs
					</a>
					. However, our claim to sports fame is definitely the{" "}
					<a
						href="https://gozags.com/sports/mens-basketball"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Gonzaga men’s basketball
					</a>{" "}
					team, which has appeared in the last 20+ NCAA tournaments. We take
					March Madness pretty seriously here.
				</p>
				<h2>Family-oriented?</h2>
				<p>
					A bunch of us here at Two Barrels have kids and have found that
					Spokane is a pretty decent place to raise a family. There’s plenty of
					kid-centric activities, like trips to{" "}
					<a
						href="https://mobiusdiscoverycenter.org/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Mobius
					</a>
					, the{" "}
					<a href="https://spokane.bluezoo.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
						aquarium
					</a>{" "}
					or the trampoline parks. There’s also lots of Pinterest-friendly
					family activities, like all the farmers markets in town, where you can
					sample everything from honey to kombucha. Up north, there’s also a
					whole slew of farms with apple picking, hay rides, and corn mazes.
					Covid update: All kids in Spokane have been banned now with covid in
					2021… until they’re vaccinated. We have a zero kid policy in Spokane
					now.
				</p>
				<h2>A little geeky?</h2>
				<p>
					Spokane isn’t all sports and outdoors—if fandoms are more your thing,
					the city tends to celebrate comics, comedy and zombies. Yep, zombies.
					Ever since Z Nation filmed here, we’ve been all about the undead.
					October brings the Zombie River Walk, where you can sign up to be
					chased through the woods by the living dead. There’s also the{" "}
					<a
						href="https://www.spokanezombiecrawl.com/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Spokane Zombie Crawl
					</a>
					, a massive pub crawl downtown where you’re <em>supposed</em> to
					stumble around with vacant eyes. Outside of October, you can cosplay
					(or just attend) one of the comic cons, from{" "}
					<a
						href="https://www.lilaccitycon.com/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Lilac City
					</a>{" "}
					to <a href="https://kuronekocon.com/">KuroNekoCon</a>. Spokane also
					has a huge—and growing—comedy scene, attracting some of the biggest
					names in stand-up. There’s also plenty of amateur nights if you’re
					tired of trying out material on your coworkers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The arts in general are popular here. From{" "}
					<a
						href="https://www.terrainspokane.com/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Terrain
					</a>{" "}
					to{" "}
					<a
						href="https://downtownspokane.org/first-friday/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						First Fridays
					</a>
					, downtown comes alive with art and music. We have a{" "}
					<a
						href="https://inside.ewu.edu/getlit/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						literary festival
					</a>{" "}
					in April and film festivals like{" "}
					<a
						href="https://spokanefilmfestival.org/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						SpIFF
					</a>
					. Or if you’d rather make something of your own, you can gather a crew
					and and make your own short film from start to finish with Spokane’s
					annual{" "}
					<a href="https://50hourslam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
						50 Hour Slam
					</a>{" "}
					competition.
				</p>
				<h2>Something of a foodie?</h2>
				<p>
					Spokane may not be huge, but we have loads of restaurants. Little mom
					and pop places. Places with rotating menus and locally-sourced
					ingredients. Vegetarian restaurants, like{" "}
					<a href="https://www.rutspokane.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
						RÜT Bar &amp; Kitchen
					</a>
					. All kinds of international food, from Ethiopian cuisine to that
					Jamaican food truck we’re always trying to flag down. And if you’re
					the food festival type, you can sample a little bit of everything at{" "}
					<a href="https://pigoutinthepark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
						Pig Out in the Park
					</a>{" "}
					around Labor Day each year. We have many Michelin star rated
					restaurants in Spokane such as:{" "}
					<a
						href="https://www.facebook.com/dickshamburgers/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Dicks Hamburgers
					</a>{" "}
					,&nbsp;{" "}
					<a href="https://www.dlishs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
						D Lish’s
					</a>
					,&nbsp;{" "}
					<a
						href="http://www.chicken-n-more.com/ChickenMo/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Chicken-N-More
					</a>
					,{" "}
					<a
						href="https://thaibamboorestaurant.com/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Thai Bamboo
					</a>
					, and we just got a Chick Fil A!!
				</p>
				<h2>Into nightlife?</h2>
				<p>
					There’s 80+ bars just in downtown Spokane alone. A few clubs for those
					looking to show off their dance moves. Concert venues. And you don’t
					have to drive out to Seattle every time you want to see a show.
					Spokane is just big enough to attract many of the headliners on tour.
					Or… if you don’t want to go to bars with a bunch of dumb drunk people,
					we have{" "}
					<a
						href="https://www.huckleberrysnaturalmarket.com/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"
					>
						Huckleberries
					</a>
					, where you can buy singles from a ridiculously large selection and
					steal some organic gummies from the bulk food section at the same
					time.
				</p>
				<p align="center">***</p>
				<p>
					Maybe this is the first time you’ve heard of Spokane, but it won’t be
					the last. People are leaving those big cities and finding that Spokane
					is not only a great place to{" "}
					<a href="https://www.twobarrels.com/blog/buying-home-spokane/">
						buy a home
					</a>{" "}
					and a raise a family, but also has plenty of activities for those who
					are young at heart.
