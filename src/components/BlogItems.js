We have folks who work in the office full-time or as part of a hybrid position—in fact, we have writers, developers, executives, and administrators who live in each of the U.S. time zones.

Therefore I made it my goal to try as many local fried chicken sandwiches as I could, and hopefully not die from a heart attack in the process. I ordered chicken sandwiches at a total of...",

So I thought this might be a great time to write a blog post about the meaning of “done” at Two Barrels. So what is the definition of “done”? “Done” is when the problem a customer, an employee, or the company needed solved has been solved. But is there really such a... ",
