				A Work From Home comfort package will be available to choose items to
				make a more productive and comfortable at home work experience. Need a
				new chair? Cool. A desk? Weâ€™ve got you covered. Additionally, eligible
				employees qualify for a WFH quarterly allowance. Think of this allowance
				as a way to upgrade your internet, pay for downtown parking, or to buy
				yourself a fancy espresso machine. You do you.
