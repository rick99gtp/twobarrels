            <h2>What is Two Barrels?</h2>
            <p>Well… it’s not a gun company or a brewery…. Two Barrels LLC is a subsidiary of <a href="https://www.registeredagentsinc.com/">Registered Agents Inc</a>.
                &nbsp;Two Barrels services our parent company’s tech needs. We have a systems team, 
                a software team, and a marketing team. These teams work together to build 
                and maintain all aspects of our parent company’s websites and to support any other 
                tech projects that are needed.
                </p>
            <p>We’re locally owned and operated. Debt free. No venture capital or shareholders pulling 
                the strings. We don’t do work for 3rd parties. We don’t have budgets. Two Barrels is 
                truly a unique opportunity and environment in Spokane and Austin.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to provide a stable, quality job where the work matters. We don’t have a lot 
                of fancy titles or beautiful org charts. We have lots of talent though where the work 
                itself brings fulfillment. If doing good and great work is fulfilling to you, we’d love 
                to talk about hiring you.</p>
