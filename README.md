# Project Description

After discovering the Two Barrels website, besides being highly impressed with Two Barrels for their core values, ability to learn/try things out even if they fail miserably and the way their website speaks to me, I wanted to show my enthusiasm and knowledge that I can do what is required for the job, even using a library like React. Using the skills that I have, I created this website using React and React Router.

This project uses 40 components, each with their own integrated stylesheet.

# Technologies Used

This project is created with:

* React - useState and useEffect Hooks.
* React Router - instead of anchor tags, using Link components provided by React Router.
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* Javascript

# Problems Faced

* Github Pages has an issue with React Router - typing directly into the address bar to go to a specific page will fail. I have yet to circle back to address and resolve the issue.

* I created this desktop-first...instead of what I normally do, which is mobile-first. This caused a few problems with styling for tablets and mobile.

# What I learned

It was really fun to create the Two Barrels website. It's always a challenge to try new things, but I really enjoy doing just that. I'm looking for my next challenging project to start!
