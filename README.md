# Project Description

After discovering the Two Barrels website, besides being highly interested in joining this company (their core values, ability to learn/try things out even if they fail miserably and the way their website speaks to me), I wanted to show my enthusiasm and knowledge that I can do what is required for the job, even using a library like React. Using the skills that I have, I created this website using React and React Router.

This project uses 40 components, each with their own integrated stylesheet.

# Technologies Used

This project is created with:

* React 17 - useState and useEffect Hooks.
* React Router - instead of anchor tags, I'm using Link components provided by React Router
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* Javascript

# Problems Faced

* Github Pages has an issue with React Router and typing directly into the address bar. I have yet to circle back to address and resolve the issue.

# What I learned

I learned that React is the library that was just made for me. I love it! Firestore databases are amazing. Coming from a SQL background, a noSQL database with documents wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. Implementing React Redux to manage the state of the app was also not as difficult as I expected, either. At my current job, we used Flux, so it was easy to adapt and learn.

# Takeaways

This was a really fun project to create. I finished working on this project September 26, 2021...late into the night. Deployed on Github Pages.

Thanks for reading!
